Description : TASK 4 (E-learning platform UI)

Working on this e-learning platform project has been a really valuable experience for me because it combined both front-end development skills and the use of version control systems like Git and GitHub. The process was not just about writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code, but also about learning how to organize files, create multiple pages, style them consistently, and finally host everything on GitHub so that the project is available online. I’ll break down the key activities and what I learned while completing this task.

The first step of the project was to design and implement the structure of the e-learning platform. I created multiple HTML pages such as index.html, about.html, contact.html, courses.html, and login.html. Each of these files serves a specific role — for example, the index page acts as the landing page, the courses page lists all available programming courses, the login page helps in creating a secure entry point, while the about and contact pages give background information and ways to connect. By splitting everything into separate files instead of having a long scrolling single-page design, the platform became more structured and user-friendly.

After creating the HTML structure, I styled everything with CSS. I made sure that the background colors looked modern and aesthetic, choosing shades like sage green or beige to give it a professional e-learning vibe. Titles were made bold, some parts italic where emphasis was needed, and proper spacing was maintained so the design didn’t look cluttered. In addition, I used hover effects, navigation menus, and a responsive layout so that the platform works smoothly on different devices.

The next part was adding interactivity through JavaScript. This included handling things like navigation, login validation, and dynamic UI elements. Having separate files (styles.css for styling and script.js for logic) helped in keeping the project clean and modular, which is a good practice for professional development.

Once the design and coding part was done, the real challenge was uploading all of these files to GitHub. Initially, I tried dragging and dropping the files one by one, but since the project had many files and folders, that method failed and GitHub gave errors. The better solution was to use Git in the terminal. I initialized a Git repository in my project folder using git init, then staged all files with git add ., and created my first commit with git commit -m "First commit - eLearning platform". After that, I connected the project to my GitHub repository link and pushed everything using git push -u origin main.

When I saw the terminal output showing successful enumeration, compression, and upload of 68 objects with a total size of around 33 MB, it was a very satisfying moment. It confirmed that my project files were now safe on GitHub and could be accessed from anywhere. This step also gave me hands-on practice with Git commands and taught me how version control helps in managing projects efficiently.

The final part of the task was checking the repository on GitHub and preparing it for deployment. By using GitHub Pages, the project can be hosted online and accessed through a live URL, making it more than just code files — it becomes a real, usable website.
